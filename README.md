# DocuSim-Google-Docs-Revision-History-Simulator
DocuSim is a Python program designed to demonstrate the potential unreliability of Google Docs revision history as a sole source of truth for determining the creation process of a document.  It simulates human-like typing behavior, complete with realistic pauses, errors, corrections, and variations in typing speed.
